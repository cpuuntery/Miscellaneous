Create bootable windows vhd/vhdx image and maybe even linux

1- you need an intermediate virtual disk to write the acronis backup image 
2- create a fat32 partition at the beginning of the disk --BUT DO NOT SET THE TYPE TO EFI PARTITION JUST YET--
3- write the acronis image to the partition after the fat32 partition 
4- use easy uefi to put efi boot files inside the fat32 partition 
5- change the fat32 partition type to efi partition
6- create an empty vhd/vhdx image and add the vhd file as a virtual disk to the virtual machine. you can not add vhdx as virtual disk to the virtual machine. so just create vhdx disk
7- copy the intermediate virtual disk to the virtual vhd/vhdx disk using MiniTool Partition
8- mount the vhd/vhdx disk image and rebuild the EFI partition inside the disk image using easyuefi
9- unmount the vhd/vhdx disk image


The windows image must have an EFI partition as the first partition, in other words the beginning of the disk 
you can create EFI partition using EasyUEFI and if EasyUEFI did not work you can use macrium as a secondary option
