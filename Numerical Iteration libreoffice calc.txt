The function[INDIRECT] returns the text content of a range of cells. The return text changes based on the place of the function

=INDIRECT("Range of any cells whether they are adjacent or not. The only requirement for the range to be valid")
=INDIRECT("A1:A25")

You can use [&] to add a string after the returned value

=INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Location.Y"

You can use the function more than once, but only the first one will start with = 
the second time you use it, you must put it inside parentheses and remove the = 
to connect the function, you will add Ampersand[&] outside the Parenthesis[()]

Example 1

=INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Location.Y,"&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Width, ")

Example 2

=INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Location.Y,"&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Width,")&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Height")


Example 3

=INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Location.X,"&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Location.Y,")&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Width,")&(INDIRECT("A1:A25")&".Height")

Will turn out

button1.Location.X,button1.Location.Y,button1.Width,button1.Height
